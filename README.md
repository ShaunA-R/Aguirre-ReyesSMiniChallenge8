Thank you for giving me a peer review

reviewed by Isaiah Ferguson: The Program functions properly i like how the code is spaced and very readable. i would add more instructions on the restart of the program. like Type Yes to replay. he might want to add another if statement if the diffuculty setting wasn't typed properly. over all great program that needs some small tweaks :)
